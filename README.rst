TDPP stands for Tabular Data PreProcessing.

This package offers a set of tools to process tabular data, such as the ones you
can find in an excel file.

For now, there is no documentation and the code works only for a specific project,
as the configuration is encoded in the python files.

But configuration files (yaml) will be added soon so it can applies to any data.

Documentation will also be added.
